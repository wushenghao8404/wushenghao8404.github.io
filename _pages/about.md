I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Department of Comoputing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am also a member of [MIND Lab](https://www.mindlab-ai.com/) (Machine Intelligence and Nature-Inspired Computing Lab), which is led by professor [Kay Chen Tan](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-tan-kay-chen/). I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in the School of Computer Science and Engineering from the South China University of Technology in 2019 and 2023, respectively, where I was very fortunate to be advised by professor [Zhi-Hui Zhan](https://zhanapollo.github.io/zhanzhh/) (詹志辉). My research interests include learning to optimize, multi-task optimization, evolutionary computation, and transfer learning.
